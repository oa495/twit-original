Welcome to the Twitter info 
=========================

This site, when complete, allows you to see the following/follower count of a specifed Twitter account. This is done by making a call to the users/lookup Twitter API endpoint.

To complete this you need to create a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/) to get your API keys and enter them into the .env file. 


Happy hacking!
